# Identifying Potential Areas for Urban Agriculture!

Welcome to the Omdena-Milan challenge. 
In this collaborative endeavor we aim to harness the power of data and technology to identify potential urban areas for farming in Milan, Italy.

Through this challenge, participants will leverage their expertise in data science, machine learning, and geographic information systems (GIS) 
to identify and analyze potential areas for urban agriculture in Milan. By analyzing factors such as sunlight exposure, soil quality, water availability, 
and accessibility, we aim to map out optimal locations for cultivating a variety of crops within the city.

Together, we can unlock the potential of urban spaces and cultivate a sustainable food system for generations to come.
